# stock_news

In main.py customize the global variables STOCK_SYMBOL and COMPANY_NAME. Then run main.py to get hold of the current difference of yesterday's closing price of your stock and the previous closing price (in percentage). 
If your stock increases/decreases by 5 % or more, get the three latest news about the company.
Functionalities can be extended e.g. by code for sending e-mail alerts (see the code example at the end of main.py).
To automate the e-mail alert, you need to host the program in the cloud (e.g. pythonanywhere).
